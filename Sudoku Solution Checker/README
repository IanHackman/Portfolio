Help Received: All programming was done as a pair. TAs Elizabeth and Julia 
               were consulted for questions concerning 
               mallocing and reading in pgms. THe Hanson quick reference, 
               UArray supplemental chapter and the course textbook 'The C 
               Programming Language' were consulted for implementing the Hanson
               data structures UArray and stack. The Pnmrdr interface was used 
               for reading in pgms and pbms.

Correctly Implemented: The entirety of unblackedges.c, sudoku.c, Bit2.h and 
                       Bit2.c and UArray.h and Uarray.c have been implemented 
                       correctly and function on all inputs and edge cases of 
                       sudoku and bitmaps for each program respectively.

Hours Spent: 15 hours
