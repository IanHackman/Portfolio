Compile/run:
     - Compile using
            make MetroSim and make
     - run executable with
            ./MetroSim stationsFile passFile [commands]


Program Purpose:
    Run the metroSim program where a file of stations is printed and the user can either assign new 
    passengers to embark and disembark at specific stations or move the train to pick up and drop off 
    the added passengers. The program contains two classes, MetroSim and PassengerQueue and one struct, 
    Passenger. MetroSim contains the functions that read in the files and execute the commands. 
    PassengerQueue creates the queue lists that the STations struct in MetroSim uses and also includes 
    funcitons to add, remove, check the size of and print the queue. Passenegr contains the struct 
    that holds the information for each new passenger assigned by the user. It also contains a function 
    element to print itself out. All three are linked and initiated in main.cpp by constructing a 
    MetroSim instance from the given files in the terminal.
